I am a graduate student in [Environmental Chemistry](https://www.chem.utoronto.ca/research/environmental.php) at the University of Toronto. I am currently working on studying complex systems using NMR spectroscopy and aquatic organisms. I am also passionate about science outreach, and am a site coordinator for [Let's Talk Science](http://outreach.letstalkscience.ca/scarborough.html) at the University of Toronto Scarborough.
